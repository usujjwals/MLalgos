## eBay Auction Analysis with Bagging and Random Forests

This project is a data science assignment focused on analyzing eBay auction data. The primary objective is to build and evaluate predictive models to classify auction outcomes using ensemble methods, specifically Bagging and Random Forests.

### üìù Project Overview

The core of this project is the `AssignmentBaggingRF.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. It details the entire machine learning workflow, including:
* **Data Loading:** Importing the `eBayAuctions.csv` dataset.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical features for modeling.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the data to understand relationships between features and the target variable.
* **Model Building:** Implementing a Bagging Classifier and a Random Forest Classifier.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** (Potentially) Optimizing the models to achieve the best performance.

### üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

* `AssignmentBaggingRF.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all Python code and analysis.
* `eBayAuctions.csv`: The dataset used for this project, containing information about various eBay auctions.

### üìä Dataset

The `eBayAuctions.csv` file provides the data for this analysis. While the notebook contains the full data dictionary, the dataset likely includes features such as:
* Item category
* Currency
* Seller rating
* Auction duration
* Starting price
* Ending price
* ...and a target variable (e.g., whether the auction was successful or not).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology

This project focuses on **ensemble learning** to improve predictive performance over a single model.

1.  **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating):** A `BaggingClassifier` (likely using Decision Trees as the base estimator) is trained. Bagging works by training multiple models on different random subsets of the data (with replacement) and averaging their predictions.

2.  **Random Forest:** A `RandomForestClassifier` is also implemented. Random Forest is an extension of bagging that also introduces randomness at the feature selection level for each split, further reducing variance and improving model robustness.

The performance of both models is compared to determine the most effective approach for this dataset.
